# ThirdLove-Email

Email Developer - Pre-Interview Exercise

The email team has been noticing that conversion rates are low on a critical email in their onboarding automation.  After further investigation, they have developed three hypotheses they want to test to get performance back on track:

- Current email is not presenting enough different product to engage the user outside their “initial” FitFinder quiz recommendations
- CTAs are not noticeable enough to drive click-through
- Competitor emails are utilizing more visual imagery, gifs and embedded video, which makes ours seem dull in comparison

Taking this feedback into account, the team has prepared the below brief for a new design:

Project: DRIP EMAIL - Fashion product feature
Due Date: XX-XX-2018

Description:

Development of new email to introduce new customers to fashion products outside our classic core.  It will be the third email a new customer receives, 10 days after delivery of their first purchase.  This particular customer segment is focused on staying up with the latest trends (having grown up on fast fashion) and skews to the late 20s-early 30s age range.  She is currently shopping across multiple retailers for her bras to satisfy her need for newness and variety, and is often more willing to put up with fit/comfort issues than others.  Content should feature product imagery over editorial imagery and would ideally have a gif, video, or carousel that renders on most major email platforms.  Please focus on featuring fashion colors and styles such as the images below.

We would like to have two CTAs: One in the top slice saying “Shop Now” and one in the secondary slice for shoppable content.

The copywriting team has already developed the SL, P/H, and primary text:

SL: More to love!
PH: Meet our other styles
Copy: You already love your new bra.  Why don’t you meet some other styles?

Taking this into consideration and the inspiration from the imagery below, please design and develop an email that you think could help drive conversion and meet the team’s requirements.  Please provide design slices as well as the HTML code when you are finished.  Bonus points if you run it through Litmus or EmailonAcid for us!
